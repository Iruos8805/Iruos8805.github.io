I have always been curious and always think about the future, past, and present of anything and everything I see.

This curiosity has always pulled me to technology and films. I have always believed that the two are intertwined as films fill dreams in an innovator's mind of what the future can be and at the same time what it used to be thus pushing a person to create something better, challenging, and new. The growing world of Artificial Intelligence for the last couple of years has attracted me to know, learn, and innovate more in this field. I am curious to know about the infinite number of potential applications of Artificial Intelligence across fields. I have always been interested in delivering speeches and directing plays and thus I believe these help me visualize and execute ideas resonating across fields.\n\nOne can connect with me at the following platforms:\nTwitter\nGithub",
