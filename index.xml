      <description>I like to test myself with challenges that demand atmost dedication, patience and thinking. I strongly believe that challenges,tasks and obstacles act as a sieve that will help in draining crisp and perfect results from a person. I yearn for anything and everything that will provide me with valuable exposure and connections filling me with experience and knowledge needed to improve myself in whatever field it may be.
I have always been curious and always thinks about the future,past and present of anything and everything I see.</description>

      <description>MY APPROACH TO THE TASK My approach to this task was no different from my approach to other tasks. I made sure that I understood the task clearly and then proceeded to work on it. I approached Youtube videos and Hugo websites to understand more about the different themes and websites. I made sure I understood what a portfolio website was and tried to create one with my limited progress in this field.</description>
