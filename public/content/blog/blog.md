# MY APPROACH TO THE TASK

My approach to this task was no different from my approach to other tasks. I made sure that I understood the task clearly and then proceeded to work on it. I approached Youtube videos and Hugo websites to understand more about the different themes and websites. I made sure I understood what  a portfolio website was and tried to create one with my limited progress in this field. I referred the example site that was given in the Hugo webiste to form the base of my website.Youtube videos were my boon in completing this tak as it guided me in editing and manupulating different codes to get the desired output which in this case was a clean and simple portfolio website.
