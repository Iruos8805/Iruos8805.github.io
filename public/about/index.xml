      <description>I like to test myself with challenges that demand atmost dedication, patience and thinking. I strongly believe that challenges,tasks and obstacles act as a sieve that will help in draining crisp and perfect results from a person. I yearn for anything and everything that will provide me with valuable exposure and connections filling me with experience and knowledge needed to improve myself in whatever field it may be.
I have always been curious and always thinks about the future,past and present of anything and everything I see.</description>
