# MY APPROACH TO THE TASK

My approach to this task was no different from my approach to other tasks. I made sure that I understood the task clearly and then proceeded to work on it. I approached Youtube videos and Hugo websites to understand more about the different themes and websites. I made sure I understood what  a portfolio website was and tried to create one with my limited progress in this field. I referred the example site that was given in the Hugo webiste to form the base of my website. I was able to design my website and launch it successfully in Github Pages. Due to some error or issue the style or theme was however not applied to the website pages. I was able to fix the issue for the main page, however I was not able to do the same for the ABOUT and BLOG page till 30th October, which is when I analysed the issue myslef and then fixed it.
