I like to test myself with challenges that demand atmost dedication, patience and thinking. I strongly believe that challenges,tasks and obstacles act as a sieve that will help in draining crisp and perfect results from a person. I yearn for anything and everything that will provide me with valuable exposure and connections filling me with experience and knowledge needed to improve myself in whatever field it may be.

I have always been curious and always thinks about the future,past and present of anything and everything I see. I always think about how a particular thing or object can develop in the future, how much it has changed from its past and thus how much we have been able to achieve. This curiosity has always pulled me to technology and films. I have always believed that the two are intertwined as films fill dreams in an innovator's mind of what the future can be be and at the same time what it used to be thus pushing a person to create something better, challenging and new. The growing world of Artificial Intelligence for the last couple of years has attracted me to know,learn and innovate more in this field. I am curious to know about the infinite number of potential applications of Artificial Intelligence across fields.I have always been interested in delivering speeches and directing plays and thus i believe these help me visualise and execute ideas resonating across fields.
